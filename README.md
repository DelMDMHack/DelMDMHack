 ive tried changing my laptops & phones, other devices, phones numbers, emails. It's definitely pinpointed that I'm a victim to these attacks daily and need other ethical  IT professionals to help me resolve this or point the proper people in the developer IT Administrator community to help me. Since my communications are filtered, try 949 337 9626 or paul128cardenas@gmail.com, or 19403 LA Guardia St., RH, CA, 917548
It's starting to spill into personal life with their brazen actions harassing me and abusing. as you can see I'm new here so hopefully this gets to the right people to help or point me in right directions so swift action is taken. I have no money to steal, I don't know who they are, for the past couple of years my devices and accounts are managed by some hackers targeting me and who know who else
